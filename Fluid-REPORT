No Change

Code Run:

I augmented the main loop so it checks when a parameter has changed specifically density and viscosity and then
in one step it will recompute the factorizations and some fixed matrices. This can cause the case where density = 0 leading 
to undefined behavior since we divide by density.

Extra Credit:

No changed

Working Features:

Everything should be working, with the exception of error checking for zero density
